Our team uses GitHub for our code repository and code review. GitHub also allows you to follow your favorite open-source repositories to watch how the codebase is changing. For this exercise, we’d like you to build an Android app that shows Pull Requests (PRs) on a given repo. The main purpose of the app is to view the source changes (aka “diffs”) associated with the PRs.
